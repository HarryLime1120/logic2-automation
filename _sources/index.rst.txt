Saleae Logic 2 Automation Interface Documentation
=================================================

The Logic 2 Automation Interface allows developers to automate the Saleae Logic 2 software.

The API is exposed via gRPC (https://grpc.io/), and the gRPC proto is available to use directly. This documentation covers the Saleae Python library, which wraps the gRPC interface. Other languages can still be used with the gRPC interface directly.
